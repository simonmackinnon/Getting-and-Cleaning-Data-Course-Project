### Assumptions

1. Assumption that only total mean or standard deviation values are what is meant by "Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement." i.e. that columns with names ending with "mean()" or "std()" are to be extracted, and not columns with names containing "mean" or "std" somewhere else.

2. Assume units of measurement are the same for linear acceleration and gravity, i.e. 'g'
